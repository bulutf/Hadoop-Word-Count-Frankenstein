# Hadoop-Word-Count-Frankenstein

Initialized an EC2 instance in AWS.  
Configured a pseudo-distributed mode Hadoop cluster.  

Project Gutenberg is an online library. Downloaded the text file of  
Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley from there.  

Used Map-Reduce to count distinct words in the book.
